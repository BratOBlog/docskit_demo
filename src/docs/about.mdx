## About DocsKit

DocsKit is an open-source tool that simplifies the way documentation is created, managed, and delivered. It provides teams with a comprehensive set of features and technical foundations to streamline their documentation workflow, resulting in enhanced performance, accessibility, and sustainability.

## DocsKit, how it is different from Gatsby?

The user needs only to upload documentation in the docs folder as MDX files.

Part of the magic happens based on [Gatsby shadowing](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/plugins-and-themes/shadowing/).

In a nutshell Gatsby lets you use your own code/content without overwriting the themes original files.




For example:

> In this case, the file to shadow is gatsby-theme-blog/src/components/bio.js.

> The shadowing API uses a deterministic file structure to determine which component will be rendered. In order to override the Bio component in gatsby-theme-blog, create a file named user-site/src/gatsby-theme-blog/components/bio.js.

> Any file that lives in the src/gatsby-theme-blog directory of the user’s site will be used instead of a file with the same name located in the theme’s src directory: gatsby-theme-blog/src. This replaces the entire file: to re-use parts of the original file from the theme such as functionality or styling, check out the sections of this doc on extending and importing shadowed files.

> This means that user-site/src/gatsby-theme-blog/components/bio.js will be rendered in place of gatsby-theme-blog/src/components/bio.js.



Under the hood DocsKit uses the below custom plugins:

[@platformos/gatsby-theme-platformos-docskit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@platformos/gatsby-theme-platformos-docskit)

This plugin has the necessary plugins and configuration already included for DocsKit to work.



[@platformos/gatsby-plugin-posify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@platformos/gatsby-plugin-posify?activeTab=readme)

This plugin is used to create the required file structure for a PlatformOS deployment.


`npm run develop --prefix src` is the command to initiate the dev server.
